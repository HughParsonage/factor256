<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of factor256 is to minimize the memory footprint of data analysis that
uses categorical variables with fewer than 256 unique values.

## Installation

You can install the development version of factor256 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("HughParsonage/factor256")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r basic-example}
library(factor256)
x <- factor256(LETTERS)
typeof(x)
identical(recompose256(x), LETTERS)
```
